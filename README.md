# Posture Assessment using Computer Vision

Photogrammetry is the science of making measurements from photographs. This projects aims at automating photogrammatery using computer vision to measure postural parameters using retroreflective markers placed at key vertebra points.  

Some points which can be measured mathematically are: 
1. Thoracic flexion angle 
2. Lumbar angle 
3. Linear value of the Spine 
4. Cranio-vertebral Angle
